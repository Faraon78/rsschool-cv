### ABOUT ME

I am able to organize my working time in a deadline, as I have worked as a chief accountant for more than 20 years, I am engaged in self-education, I am balanced, I can work in a team. I decided to change my profession, because I think that not all of my abilities have yet been revealed. I chose Front-End development, because the result of the work is immediately visible in it, there is a place not only for logic, but also for creativity.
